## Description
This project was created to assist people that want an easy way to create quality README files for their projects with little thought. After the necessary installations are completed the user is then able to run a command and is then presented with a number of prompts regarding information about their project. After these prompts are answered then a README is automatically created for them based on the user's answers.

## Installation Instructions
Open the Command Prompt and change your directory to the top level of this application. Once at that directory, run 'npm init -y.' Once this is completed you will need to run 'npm i inquirer.' Once this is done you should be good to go.

## Requirements
- When the user is prompted for about their application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
- When the user enters their project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README.
- When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. 
- When the user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
- When the user enters their GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
- When the user enters their email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
- When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.


## Usage Information

Once entered, the user will be prompted a number of questions regarding information about their project. Once all of the prompts are answered then a README file will be automatically created for them.
